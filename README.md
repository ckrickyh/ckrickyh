# Hi, I'm Ricky! 🌳💻

Welcome to my GitHub!

After 10+ years as a certified arborist, I am pivoting my career to software development. My experience managing large tree inventories led me to build custom solutions using Python—handling GIS data, automating workflows, and creating interactive web maps for my team. I even developed automated WhatsApp reminders for field tasks.

Recently, I completed a coding bootcamp focused on backend development and cloud technologies:
- **Java Spring Boot**
- **Docker & Redis**
- **AWS**
- **PostgreSQL**

I also earned a free OpenCV Introduction Certificate, further expanding my skills in computer vision and image processing.

I'm now actively seeking developer roles, especially those using Java Spring Boot. My background gives me a unique perspective—I'm a problem solver with real-world experience building practical tools for teams.

Why consider me?
- I’ve built software for real-world needs in demanding environments.
- I’m passionate about learning and creating impactful solutions.
- My journey from tree management to tech shows my adaptability and drive.

Explore my projects to see how I merge field expertise with modern development. I’m excited to grow as a developer and contribute to innovative teams!
