# Hi, I'm Ricky! 🌳💻🐾

Welcome to my GitHub!

After more than 10 years as a certified arborist, I’m excited to transition my career into software development. My journey began in the field, managing thousands of trees and leading teams in large-scale environmental projects. In those years, I discovered a passion for solving problems with code—building Python tools for GIS mapping, automating workflows, and even creating interactive web maps and WhatsApp reminders to help my team work smarter.

Recently, I completed a coding bootcamp with a focus on backend development and cloud technologies:
- **Java Spring Boot**
- **Docker & Redis**
- **AWS**
- **PostgreSQL**

I also earned an OpenCV Introduction Certificate, expanding my skills into computer vision and image processing.

Now, I’m looking for my next challenge in backend development, especially in Java Spring Boot. My background gives me a unique perspective—I’m a creative problem solver with hands-on experience building software for real-world needs.

Why consider me?
- I’ve built practical tech solutions in demanding field environments.
- I’m passionate about continuous learning and creating impactful applications.
- My story—from tree management to tech—demonstrates adaptability, resilience, and drive.

When I’m not coding or working with trees, you’ll often find me spending time with my cat. I believe that balance and curiosity make for a better developer and teammate!

Explore my projects to see how I blend field expertise, technical skills, and a love of learning. I’m excited to contribute to innovative teams and grow as a developer.
