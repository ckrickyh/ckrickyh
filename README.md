Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a certified arborist with over 10 years of experience in large-scale tree management and environmental data analysis. Now, I'm transitioning into software development to leverage technology in solving real-world challenges.

My programming journey began with a focus on developing applications that improve operational efficiency. I've created several real-world projects, including:

- Robotic Process Automation (RPA) applications
- Web Mapping Applications
- Automated Notification Systems
  
Through a 2.5-months with 500+ hours immersive bootcamp, I learned Java and Spring Boot, culminating in a final project: a Stock Heatmap application.

Feel free to check out **my projects 🚀**:
