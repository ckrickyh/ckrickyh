Welcome to my GitHub!

After over 10 years as a certified arborist, specializing in large-scale tree management and environmental data, I am excited to make a career transition into software development.

## My Journey

- 🌲 As a tree specialist, I developed advanced data management solutions for large areas, using Python for GIS analysis, automation, and interactive web mapping.
- 📈 Built tools for my team, including automated WhatsApp reminders for field tasks, and web-based mapping dashboards to streamline work across thousands of trees.
- 🏆 I am a tree management professional and a passionate problem solver and builder, with a strong technical foundation.

## My Developer Path

Recently, I completed an intensive bootcamp focused on backend development and cloud technologies:
- **Java Spring Boot**
- **Docker & Redis**
- **AWS Cloud Services**
- **PostgreSQL Database**

I am actively seeking opportunities as a backend developer (Java Spring Boot), where I can combine my real-world experience, innovative mindset, and technical skills to create impactful solutions.

## Why Hire Me?

- I bring a unique perspective from years of hands-on field work and leadership.
- I have proven experience building practical software for real teams and business needs.
- I am deeply motivated to grow and thrive in the developer industry.

## What Sets Me Apart?
- I’ve developed practical tech solutions in demanding field environments.
- I’m passionate about continuous learning and creating impactful applications.
- My journey—from tree management to tech—demonstrates adaptability, resilience, and drive.

When I’m not coding or working with trees, you’ll often find me spending time with my cat. I believe that balance and curiosity make for a better developer and teammate!

Explore my projects to see how I blend field expertise, technical skills, and a love of learning. I’m excited to contribute to innovative teams and grow as a developer.
